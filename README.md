# Online Tendering DApp (Python Backend with Streamlit Interface)

## Overview
The **Online Tendering DApp** is a decentralized application designed for managing tenders and bids on the Ethereum blockchain. It has two main components:

- **Frontend**: Built using **Streamlit** to create a user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Managed with **Flask (Python)**, which handles application logic and interacts with Ethereum smart contracts.

Users can interact with the blockchain through **MetaMask** wallet integration, enabling them to submit bids, create tenders, and view real-time tender details.

```

## Setting Up and Running the DApp

### 1. Install Dependencies
Before starting the DApp, install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install streamlit
pip install web3
```

### 2. Running the Application
To run the application:

- **Start the Streamlit Interface**:

  Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend/app directory:

  ```bash
  cd frontend/app
  ```

  Run the following command to start Streamlit:

  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```

  Alternatively, you can use a live server to open `index.html` in your browser.

- **Connect MetaMask**:

  Ensure MetaMask is installed and connected to your Ethereum network. Use `metamask_login.py` to authenticate users and enable MetaMask interactions within the DApp.

## Interacting with the DApp

Once the application is running, users can:

- **Create Tenders**: Through the UI, users can create new tenders and deploy them to the blockchain using Ethereum smart contracts.
- **Place Bids**: Users can view active tenders and place bids via MetaMask.
- **View Tender Details**: By clicking on a tender, users can view additional information about its status.
- **Tender & Bid Data**: Tender and bid information is stored in `tenders_data.json` and `bids.json`, which can be replaced with a database in production.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - **Streamlit**: For building the user interface.
  - **MetaMask**: For wallet management and Ethereum interaction.

- **Backend**:
  - **Flask**: For managing backend logic and interacting with smart contracts.

- **Blockchain**:
  - **Ethereum**: Smart contracts are written in Solidity and interact with **web3.py**.

- **MetaMask**: For secure wallet management and signing Ethereum transactions.

## Conclusion

By following these instructions, you can run and interact with the **Online Tendering DApp**:

1. Start Streamlit to launch the frontend UI.
2. Connect MetaMask to interact with Ethereum.
3. Test tender creation and bidding locally before deploying to a live environment.
